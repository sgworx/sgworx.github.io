<p>I'm an architect</p>
<p>I’m interested in  spatial design, creative direction, and advanced fabrication.  
I focus on embedding AI into my design process to build intelligent, responsive design infrastructures for architecture and the other realms of design. I build tools and frameworks that connect technologies to real design needs. This makes it easier to navigate between experimentation and scalable application. 
The intention is not to automate creativity but to interrogate the system and make design as agile as the character it’s supposed to reflect.</p>
